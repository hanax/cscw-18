While paper sessions provide detailed discussions of recently completed work, panels provide an opportunity to hear from researchers in the field about about what is on the horizon - or what is already here but not yet recognized, acknowledged or discussed. Panels are designed to:
 
* Discuss relevant, important, and critical topics
* Engage the audience and provoke discussion
* Bring several disciplines, methods, or approaches in productive conversation
* Represent a diversity of individuals, who can bring multiple perspectives to the topic

The panels accepted for 2018 include:

#### Online Fandom: Boldly Going Where Few CSCW Researchers Have Gone Before
Brianna Dym (Moderator)
Cecilia Aragon
Julia Bullard
Ruby Davis
Casey Fiesler

#### Research Ethics and Regulation: An Open Forum
Casey Fiesler (Moderator)
Amy Bruckman
Robert E. Kraut
Michael Muller
Cosmin Munteanu
Katie Shilton

#### Without a Trace: How Studying Invisible Interactions Can Help Us Understand Social Media
Nicole Ellison (Moderator)
Megan French
Eden Litt
S. Shyam Sundar
Penny Trieu

#### Computer-Supported Career Development in The Future of Work
Julie Hui (Moderator)
Elizabeth M. Gerber
Bill Burnett
Lynn Dombrowski
Mary L. Gray

Workshops will be held on Saturday, November 3 and Sunday, November 4. Here is a tentative schedule of workshops. Please follow the workshop organizers’ instructions on their websites for how to submit and participate in the workshop. 

Workshop participants are required to register for their workshops (and pay the corresponding fee per workshop) via the [conference registration website](https://www.regonline.com/registration/Checkin.aspx?EventID=2158075). The CSCW 2018 Organizing Committee cannot exempt or defray these registration fees for organizers or participants. Workshop registrations can be added at any time to existing conference registrations, including on the day of the workshop. There is a registration option for attendees who are only participating in a workshop but not the main conference.

 `
Bonnie A. Nardi, Steve Whittaker, and Erin Bradner. 2000. Interaction and outeraction: instant messaging in action. In Proceedings of the 2000 ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work (CSCW '00). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 79-88. DOI: [https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/358916.358975](https://doi-org.stanford.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/358916.358975)

This paper will be awarded the 2018 Lasting Impact Award as an exemplary piece of CSCW research.  It had broad applicability at the time of its publication and has continued to influence research on commercial messaging systems, video conferencing, social networking services, and mobile communications.  Committee members agreed that the research was expertly executed and the paper beautifully crafted with quotes from participants and chat exchanges that lent richness to the findings.  We look forward to a lively discussion with the authors and a few members from the CSCW community who have been influenced by the work.

#### Session Details
Date:  Tuesday, November 6, 2018
Time:  4:30pm-5:30pm

#### Speakers:
Steve Whittaker, Professor, University of California at Santa Cruz
Frank Bentley, Principal Research Associate, Yahoo! Labs
