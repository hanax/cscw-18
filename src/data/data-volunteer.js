Student volunteers are essential to the success of the CSCW conference. In return for help at the conference, student volunteers receive a number of benefits.

### You commit to: ###

Complete 20 hours of volunteer work at the conference during November 3 â€“ November 7, 2018.

### In return, you get: ###

(please note: SV benefits are still being discussed)
* Free conference registration & reception ticket
* A fabulous t-shirt sure to be the envy of all conference goers
* Daily lunches with mentors

While the volunteer duties are not always glamorous, they do provide a unique opportunity to interact closely with CSCW contributors, attendees, and other student volunteers. Volunteering provides a structured, cordial environment for students in various stages of their research career to become part of the CSCW community. Students often report that the 'social networks' they build from these meetings are the greatest benefit of being a volunteer. Indeed, it is not uncommon for future collaborations, internships/jobs, and friendships to be made through the SV experience.

### Qualifications ###

Volunteers must be undergraduate, Master's, or Ph.D. students during the Fall semester of the 2018 academic year. All students, regardless of discipline, are encouraged to apply. No experience is required, but we are looking for enthusiastic, reliable people.

### Selection Process ###

A few student volunteer spots have been assigned to experienced student volunteers to serve as day captains, and the other spots (about 30) will be randomly assigned by the lottery system to applicants who apply by June 5, 2018. Finally, there will be a contest for designing the wonderful t-shirt that our SVs wear. The waitlisted applicant who submits the best t-shirt design will be assigned a SV spot. Further information about the t-shirt design contest will be emailed to waitlisted applicants after the initial notification deadline.

Those volunteers initially selected will be notified on June 10, 2018 so they can begin making any necessary arrangements and get involved in the online student volunteer community. The waiting list will consist of applications received by the deadline but not initially selected. Applications received after the deadline will be placed at the end of the waiting list in the order in which they are received.

Historically, more students apply than can be accepted, so early application is encouraged. However, applicants on the waiting list are often accepted, so do not be discouraged if you are applying close to or after the preliminary deadline. Some volunteers always drop out, so we highly encourage students to continue checking the waitlist.

The CSCW Student Reviewer Mentoring Program provides an opportunity for students to participate in the CSCW review process while getting guidance from senior reviewers. A small pool of students who know the CSCW field well, are matched with CSCW review mentors, who agree to support each student in writing high-quality reviews. This has four purposes. First, PC members who choose a student reviewer within the mentor program will know that the student will do a good review, since the mentor will see to that. Second, students will have the opportunity to get feedback and discuss the reviewing process with the mentor and therefore become a better reviewer. Third, the students will become expert reviewers for future CSCW conferences, where they may eventually mentor the next generation of students! Fourth, all parties can grow their professional networks through collaborative review-writing.

### Instructions, Tricks, and Trade in making CSCW reviews ###

This document contains tricks of the trade in making CSCW reviews, including overall structure, possible relevant links, and so on. The document is created with the aim of assisting and supporting new CSCW reviewers to the field but can also be used by others.

Other helpful resources are Dan Cosley's blog post "How I review papers" and Dave Randall's reflections on reviewing for CSCW.

If you have any additional interesting tricks of the trade you would like to share, please email the student reviewing chairs at [studentmentoring2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:studentmentoring2018@cscw.acm.org), and if applicable we will include your material in the instructions.

The increasing numbers of submission for CSCW as well as the revise & resubmit process makes us all dependent on a large number of good reviewers who are willing to provide expert feedback and engage with authors on their work.

In former CSCW surveys, students have stated that despite volunteering to review for CSCW they are not often chosen by PC members for reviewing tasks.

For questions, please contact the Reviewer Mentorship co-chairs listed below at [studentmentoring2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:studentmentoring2018@cscw.acm.org)
