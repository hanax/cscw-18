The ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing is an international and interdisciplinary conference focused on how technology intersects with social practices. The conference will offer several types of submission including papers, posters, demos, workshops, panels, doctoral colloquium in 2018, with details to be posted on this page in early 2018.
To bridge the gap until the 2018 paper deadline, we offer an _Online First_ call for paper participation.

## CSCW 2018 _Online First_ Call for Paper Participation

The ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing is an international and interdisciplinary conference focused on how technology intersects with social practices.  

This is an interim deadline for CSCW 2018 papers —  papers submitted for this deadline will be published *Online First*, before the CSCW 2018 annual conference, in the inaugural November 2017 Proceedings of the ACM: Human Computer Interaction (PACM). Accepted *Online First* papers will be presented in a format to be determined with recognition as CSCW full papers at the 2018 ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing in November, 2018. (Final location details will be announced soon). 

**The CSCW 2018 Conference will have a second submission deadline and separate review process during Spring 2018.**

*Online First* paper deadlines and decision notification dates are as follows. Note that this year, abstract submissions are required one week prior to the paper submission.

### Important Dates

* *April 20, 2017*: Abstract due (5:00pm PDT)

* *April 27, 2017*: Submission due (5:00pm PDT)

* *June 12, 2017*: First-round notifications (Revise & Resubmit or Reject)

* *July 10, 2017*: Revised papers due (5:00pm PDT)

* *August 6, 2017*: Final notifications *CSCW 2018 Online First*

Camera ready date and publication dates for *Online First* papers will be published soon. 

### Call for Papers

CSCW is an international and interdisciplinary peer reviewed conference seeking the best research on all topics relevant to collaborative and social computing.  We invite authors to submit papers that inform the design or deployment of collaborative or social systems; introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms; or study existing collaborative or social practices. The scope of CSCW *Online First* includes social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open collaboration, technologically-enabled or enhanced communication, CSCL, MOOCs, and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collaboration, awareness, information sharing, and coordination. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, socializing, and entertainment. Papers can report on novel research results, systems, or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities.

CSCW encourages papers that make a contribution to building CSCW systems including (but not limited to) technical enablers for CSCW applications; methods and techniques for new CSCW services and applications; and evaluation of fully-built CSCW systems and lab and field settings. 

Contributions to CSCW across a variety of research techniques, approaches, and domains, including:

* Social and crowd computing. Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information behaviors.

* System Design. Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.

* Theories. Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative systems.

* Empirical investigations. Findings, guidelines, and/or studies related to communication, collaboration, and social technologies, practices, or use. CSCW *Online First *welcomes diverse methods and approaches.

* Mining and Modeling. Studies, analyses and infrastructures for making use of large- and small-scale data.

* Methodologies and tools. Novel methods or combinations of approaches and tools used in building systems or studying their use.

* Domain-specific social and collaborative applications. Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.

* Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies. Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, or sensing systems.

* Ethics and policy implications of socio-technical systems and the algorithms that shape them.

* Crossing boundaries. Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.

Note that CSCW is moving all publications to the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM). Hence, papers for this interim *Online First* call will be part of Proceedings of the ACM : Human-Computer Interaction: Volume 1: Issue 1: Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing 2017. This will be the inaugural issue of the PACM.

A second CSCW 2018 review process will take place in Spring 2018 (date to be announced). Papers submitted to that deadline will be referred to as Spring 2018 papers.

The CSCW 2018 *Online First* published papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library and will be free for download for up to two years after publication. For more information on this open access model, see:  

http://www.sigchi.org/news/open-table-of-contents-a-new-way-to-access-acm-sigchi-publications.

CSCW does not accept submissions that were published previously in formally reviewed publications or that are currently submitted elsewhere.

## Format and Submission Process Details

### Submission Process

Abstracts must be submitted via the Precision Conference System (PCS) by 5:00 pm Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) on Thursday, April 20, 2017. Papers must be submitted via PCS by 5:00 pm Pacific Daylight TIme (PDT) on Thursday, April 27, 2017. Papers in the "Revise & Resubmit" category must be re-submitted via the PCS system by 11:59 PM PDT on July 10, 2017.

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications make the following representations (see [http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations) for full policy statement):

* That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work.

* That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue.

* That the authors have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted, if the work is accepted. For conference papers, this includes the expected ability and intent to have an author of the paper register for and attend the conference to present the paper, if required.

* That any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately in the paper and/or in a cover letter available to reviewers. This documentation includes providing an explanation of the incremental contribution of the submitted CSCW *Online First* paper that extends prior results published elsewhere. (In cases of double blind review, this information should be supplied to the program chairs only.)

In cases where an author feels a particular representation cannot be made, but that submission is appropriate, the author should contact the program chairs prior to submission to discuss the situation and determine whether submission will be permitted.

All submissions must be new work that has not been published in a peer reviewed conference or journal. Work previously published in workshops that do not have published proceedings may be submitted (as-is or extended) to CSCW *Online First*. Work previously published in workshops that do have published proceedings may only be submitted if the work is substantially extended from the workshop paper. In any case where part of a submitted paper has been previously published, the authors should contact the Papers Chairs to inform them of the prior publication, including its citation and a brief description of the changes incorporated into the CSCW *Online First*-submitted version.

Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SIGCHI regarding specialized conferences: [http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference](http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference)

Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

### Formatting and Length

Please use the SIGCHI papers template to format your submission (there is a [Word version](https://cscw.acm.org/2017/submit/sigchi-word-proceedings.zip) and a [Latex version](https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats)). Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.

There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length is 10 pages (formerly the maximum length limit), but may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages — shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers longer than 10 pages, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

### Blind Review Policy

Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."

### Video Figures

Consider submitting a video that illustrates your work, either as a video figure judged as part of your submission (no more than three minutes long and 50MB in size), or as a longer stand-alone submission to the video track. Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.

## CSCW 2018 _Online First_ Review process

*Note: The review process described below applies to the Online First submissions only, not CSCW Spring 2018 submissions.*

### Revision Cycle

Papers will undergo two review cycles. After the first round of review, a submission will receive either a "Revise & Resubmit" or a "Reject" notification (along with the reviews themselves). Authors of papers designated "Revise & Resubmit" will have two weeks to revise their paper in response to the reviewers' comments. Authors will need to allocate time for possible revisions during the period between June 12th and July 10, 2017. Revised papers must be re-submitted via the PCS system by 11:59 PM PDT on July 10, 2017. Note that an invitation to "Revise & Resubmit" is not a guarantee of acceptance--the revision will be re-reviewed as the basis for the final decision. This is similar to a journal process, except that it is limited to a single revision with a strict deadline.

The revision cycle enables authors to address issues raised by reviewers that may have been a cause for rejection under prior conference reviewing schemes, such as the need to improve readability/grammar, discuss missing citations, redo some analyses, adopt terminology familiar to the field, and/or reframe ideas more clearly. It also allows authors of papers that may have been accepted under a single-cycle approach to further strengthen their papers, perhaps better positioning themselves for consideration for "Best of CSCW 2018" recognition. Along with their revised paper, authors submit a letter explaining the key changes they have made, allowing more interaction between authors and reviewers.

With the resubmission of R&R papers, authors are asked to provide a letter explaining how they approached the comments by the reviewers and incorporated the changes in the revision. See examples of "change summary" documents submitted with papers in past CSCWs.

This is not an invitation to submit extended abstracts or incomplete papers; please submit only work of publishable quality. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will be desk-rejected without review. Based on prior years’ experience with this process, we anticipate that roughly half of submissions will be rejected after the first round of this process. Note that the dual-round review process is not inherently tied to any target acceptance rates.

### Review Criteria

Authors will be able to indicate the primary methodological orientation of their paper, when they upload the paper to the PCS reviewing system:

* Technical/Systems, e.g. building novel systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc.

* Empirical-Qualitative, e.g. ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc.

* Empirical-Quantitative, e.g. "big data," quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc.

* Design, e.g. design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc.

* Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development.

* Theoretical, e.g. conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis.

* This information will be used to match the paper with a program committee member who is experienced with work of that character. CSCW values work from a variety of interdisciplinary and methodological perspectives - specific evaluation types are not a prerequisite for acceptance (Greenberg & Buxton, 2008).

Greenberg, S., and Buxton, B. "Usability evaluation considered harmful (Some of the time)" in: CHI, ACM, Florence, Italy, 2008, pp. 111-120.

### "Best of CSCW 2018" Awards

CSCW 2018 *Online First* papers will be considered for "Best of CSCW" awards with the full set of 2018 accepted papers in accordance with SIGCHI guidelines. Papers that have been nominated as noteworthy by reviewers or Program Committee members will receive additional review by the Best Papers Committee, who will identify "Honorable Mention" and "Best" awards. Approximately 5% of submissions may be nominated and 1% of total submissions awarded Best Paper. 

### Accepted Papers

Authors will be expected to prepare a camera-ready version of their paper in accordance with ACM’s Digital Library formatting guidelines. Authors may be asked to identify funding sources (to assist in compliance with government access mandates). Further information will be provided at the time of acceptance.

The CSCW Proceedings is a peer-reviewed archival publication. Note: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. For *Online First *submissions, this date would be in late 2017. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

At least one author of each accepted CSCW 2018* Online First *paper must register for, attend, and present the paper as a poster at the CSCW 2018 conference. Failure to meet this requirement may result in withdrawal of the work from the proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library. However, given the large gap between *Online First* submissions and the conference, the conference chairs may consider exceptional cases where authors are not able to present due to unexpected circumstances.

Authors of accepted papers will have to choose whether to pay for open-access publication (this decision is made after acceptance and will not affect the review decision). Authors also will have to choose among three options for rights management: copyright transfer (or government copyright), a limited exclusive right to publish, or author-retained rights (only for author-paid open access articles). All authors of ACM-published articles retain substantial rights, see http://authors.acm.org for more details.
