The ACM conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing is an international and interdisciplinary conference focused on how technology intersects with social practices. The conference will offer several types of submission including papers, posters, demos, workshops, panels, doctoral colloquium in 2018, with details to be posted on this page in early 2018.
To bridge the gap until the 2018 paper deadline, we offered an _Online First_ call for paper participation. The Online First deadline has passed, but details about this process can be found [here](http://https://cscw.acm.org/2018/submit_online.html).

### Call for Papers

CSCW is an international and interdisciplinary peer reviewed conference seeking the best research on all topics relevant to collaborative and social computing.  We invite authors to submit papers that inform the design or deployment of collaborative or social systems; introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms; or study existing collaborative or social practices. The scope of CSCW *Online First* includes social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open collaboration, technologically-enabled or enhanced communication, CSCL, MOOCs, and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collaboration, awareness, information sharing, and coordination. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, socializing, and entertainment. Papers can report on novel research results, systems, or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities.

CSCW encourages papers that make a contribution to building CSCW systems including (but not limited to) technical enablers for CSCW applications; methods and techniques for new CSCW services and applications; and evaluation of fully-built CSCW systems and lab and field settings. 

Contributions to CSCW across a variety of research techniques, approaches, and domains, including:

* Social and crowd computing. Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information behaviors.

* System Design. Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.

* Theories. Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative systems.

* Empirical investigations. Findings, guidelines, and/or studies related to communication, collaboration, and social technologies, practices, or use. CSCW *Online First *welcomes diverse methods and approaches.

* Mining and Modeling. Studies, analyses and infrastructures for making use of large- and small-scale data.

* Methodologies and tools. Novel methods or combinations of approaches and tools used in building systems or studying their use.

* Domain-specific social and collaborative applications. Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.

* Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies. Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, or sensing systems.

* Ethics and policy implications of socio-technical systems and the algorithms that shape them.

* Crossing boundaries. Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.

Note that CSCW is moving all publications to the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM). All CSCW papers (including Online First papers) will be include in the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM) journal.

## Format and Submission Process Details

### Submission Process

CSCW 2018 is using a new version of Precision Conference System (PCS 2.0): [https://new.precisionconference.com/](https://new.precisionconference.com/). Please note that you will need to create a new login/password for this system.

PCS 2.0 is still in development, and you are encouraged to report problems or to make interface suggestions to [support@precisionconference.com](mailto:support@precisionconference.com).

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications make the following representations (see [http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations) for full policy statement):

* That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work.

* That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue.

* That the authors have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted, if the work is accepted. For conference papers, this includes the expected ability and intent to have an author of the paper register for and attend the conference to present the paper, if required.

* That any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately in the paper and/or in a cover letter available to reviewers. This documentation includes providing an explanation of the incremental contribution of the submitted CSCW *Online First* paper that extends prior results published elsewhere. (In cases of double blind review, this information should be supplied to the program chairs only.)

In cases where an author feels a particular representation cannot be made, but that submission is appropriate, the author should contact the program chairs prior to submission to discuss the situation and determine whether submission will be permitted.

All submissions must be new work that has not been published in a peer reviewed conference or journal. Work previously published in workshops that do not have published proceedings may be submitted (as-is or extended) to CSCW *Online First*. Work previously published in workshops that do have published proceedings may only be submitted if the work is substantially extended from the workshop paper. In any case where part of a submitted paper has been previously published, the authors should contact the Papers Chairs to inform them of the prior publication, including its citation and a brief description of the changes incorporated into the CSCW *Online First*-submitted version.

Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SIGCHI regarding specialized conferences: [http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference](http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference)

Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

### Formatting and Length

Please use the SIGCHI papers template to format your submission (there is a [Word version](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) and a [Latex version](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)). We ask that you use the templates provided here and not the proceedings template provided on the ACM official site. Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.

There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length is 10 pages (formerly the maximum length limit), but may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages — shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers longer than 10 pages, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

### Blind Review Policy

Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."

### Video Figures

Consider submitting a video that illustrates your work, either as a video figure judged as part of your submission (no more than three minutes long and 50MB in size), or as a longer stand-alone submission to the video track. Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.

All papers accepted for CSCW 2018 from the Online First or the subsequent final deadline are expected to be presented at CSCW 2018 by at least one of the authors. Presentation format for Online First papers may be different but is guaranteed to include some form of oral presentation at the conference. The conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons.
