      title: "Call for Papers",
      content : `
CSCW is an international and interdisciplinary peer reviewed conference seeking the best research on all topics relevant to collaborative and social computing. We invite authors to submit papers that inform the design or deployment of collaborative or social systems; introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms; or study existing collaborative or social practices. The scope of CSCW 2018 includes social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open collaboration, technologically-enabled or enhanced communication, CSCL, MOOCs, and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collaboration, awareness, information sharing, and coordination. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, sociality, entertainment, and ethics. Papers can report on novel research results, systems, or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities.

CSCW encourages papers that make a contribution to building CSCW systems including (but not limited to) technical enablers for CSCW applications; methods and techniques for new CSCW services and applications; and evaluation of fully-built CSCW systems and lab and field settings.

Contributions to CSCW across a variety of research techniques, approaches, and domains, including:

* **Social and crowd computing**. Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information behaviors.

      content: `
CSCW 2018 is using a new version of Precision Conference System (PCS 2.0): [https://new.precisionconference.com/](https://new.precisionconference.com/). Please note that you will need to create a new login/password for this system.

PCS 2.0 is still in development, and you are encouraged to report problems or to make interface suggestions to [support@precisionconference.com](mailto:support@precisionconference.com).

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications make the following representations (see [http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations) for full policy statement):

* That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work.

* That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue.

* That the authors have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted, if the work is accepted. For conference papers, this includes the expected ability and intent to have an author of the paper register for and attend the conference to present the paper, if required.

* That any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately in the paper and/or in a cover letter available to reviewers. This documentation includes providing an explanation of the incremental contribution of the submitted CSCW 2018 paper that extends prior results published elsewhere. (In cases of double blind review, this information should be supplied to the program chairs only.)

In cases where an author feels a particular representation cannot be made, but that submission is appropriate, the author should contact the program chairs prior to submission to discuss the situation and determine whether submission will be permitted.

All submissions must be new work that has not been published in a peer reviewed conference or journal. Work previously published in workshops that do not have published proceedings may be submitted (as-is or extended) to CSCW 2018. Work previously published in workshops that do have published proceedings may only be submitted if the work is substantially extended from the workshop paper. In any case where part of a submitted paper has been previously published, the authors should contact the Papers Chairs to inform them of the prior publication, including its citation and a brief description of the changes incorporated into the CSCW 2018 submitted version.

Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SIGCHI regarding specialized conferences: [http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference](http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference).

Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

`
    },
    {
      title: "Formatting and Length",
      content: `
CSCW has moved to the Proceedings of the ACM - HCI, which uses the ACM Small article template. This template is substantially different from the traditional two-column SIGCHI papers template, and may take extra time to typeset. The ACM Small template is available for download as part of the [ACM Master Template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Please use the most recent version of the master template, even if you have previously downloaded it. Several issues identified during the CSCW 2017 process have been addressed in recent updates. Word users: if the typefaces are not showing up correctly, be sure you have installed the fonts included in the ACM template download. Authors using the Overleaf platform can use the templates provided within Overleaf. Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.

_Note:_ In preparing initial submissions, authors should make their best effort at matching the ACM-Small template styles and conventions, but please don’t worry about perfect formatting at this stage! Any smaller formatting issues can be addressed during the revision cycle and camera-ready preparation stage.

There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length with the new template is about 13-15 pages (excluding images and references). Last year, most papers were under 10,000 words. Papers may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages. Shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers that exceed the typical length, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.
`
    }, 
    {
      title: "Blind Review Policy",
      content : `
Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."

CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Authors may choose to do this at their own risk but they should be aware that this can have implications for the anonymity of their work during the review process.
`
    },
    {
      title: "Open Review Summaries",
      content : `
In an effort to increase transparency and openness, CSCW will this year publish review summaries of accepted papers as supplementary material in the ACM Digital Library. The review summary will be based on the final meta-review for each paper. This is an experiment that we hope will turn into a tradition within our community. As such, we expect that the process will be improved over time as we learn together from our experiences. Review summaries (edited meta-review) of accepted papers will be published by default. However, when submitting a paper, authors will have the option to opt-out from this experiment. This choice will not impact how the paper is reviewed. (Meta-reviews of rejected papers will not be made public.)
`
    },
    {
      title: "Video Figures",
      content : `
Consider submitting a video that illustrates your work, either as a video figure judged as part of your submission (no more than three minutes long and 50MB in size), or as a longer stand-alone submission to the video track. Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.
`
    },
    {
      title: "At the Conference",
      content: `
All papers accepted for CSCW 2018 from the Online First or the subsequent Second Cycle final deadline are expected to be presented at CSCW 2018 by at least one of the authors. However, the conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons. Such papers will be included in the proceedings regardless of the author registration status, and we will seek ways for authors to present their work remotely at the conference.

Presentation format for Online First papers may be different but is guaranteed to include some form of oral presentation at the conference.

Please note that workshops receive minimal technology support, which is reflected in the low fee for attending them. This means that organizers should plan to bring their own equipment insofar as it is possible to do so (e.g., projector, laptops, portable supplies) and will be responsible for the security of their own equipment. We encourage workshop organizers to create web-based resources for their workshops so that advertising, submission and organization can be handled online.

Workshop proposals should be e-mailed to the Workshop Co-Chairs at [workshops2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:workshops2018@cscw.acm.org) by 11:59pm PDT on **Monday, 27 July 2018**. Submissions will be acknowledged via email.

Accepted workshops will need to provide a short description of the workshop for publication on the conference web site containing the workshop title, names and affiliations of organizers, 200-word abstract, workshop web site, and position paper submission or other participation requirements. The due date for the web description and workshop link is **17 August 2018**.

A final workshop description will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be distributed to all conference attendees in the Conference Proceedings Companion. This description must be submitted by **17 August 2018** and be formatted in [Extended Abstract Format](https://sigchi.org/templates/).

* Interactive posters abstracts may be chosen based on either the significance of the problem or the originality of your approach.

* Focus on the contribution of your work rather than the background, including just enough background to make clear how your work differs from significant prior research.

* Include the major graphical elements that will likely be used in the poster itself.

The space allocated for each poster is 48 inches by 48 inches (121 x 121 cm). Posters are recommended to be no longer or wider than 45 inches (114 cm) in either dimension; however, up to 47 inches (119 cm) is allowable. Smaller posters are acceptable. For example, either A0 (vertical format) or A1 is an acceptable size for the poster.

Posters should be affixed to the poster boards with push pins, not tape. The conference will provide push pins. Each board will have a label indicating where your poster should be placed; please allow time to find your board and set up your poster.

      title: "What is a Panel?",
      content: `
A panel is a collection of people discussing an important topic to our field with energy, insight, and verve - they need not be dull and boring.

Great panels are an excellent way to generate debate, raise new and interesting issues at CSCW, and hear multiple points of view on a given topic. CSCW panels are a forum for discussing provocative, controversial, innovative, emerging, boundary-spanning, and boundary-breaking issues.

While paper sessions provide detailed discussions of recently completed work, panels provide an opportunity to hear from researchers in the field about about what is on the horizon - or what is already here but not yet recognized, acknowledged or discussed.

## Criteria for Successful Panels ##

The best panels provide opportunities for audience participation. We especially encourage proposals for panels that will:

* Discuss relevant, important, and critical topics

* Engage the audience and provoke discussion

* Bring several disciplines, methods, or approaches in productive conversation

* Represent a diversity of individuals, who can bring multiple perspectives to the topic

All questions should be directed to [panels2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:panels2018@cscw.acm.org).

The CSCW 2018 Doctoral Colloquium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to discuss their research in an international forum under the guidance of a panel of experienced CSCW researchers. The Doctoral Colloquium will be held on Saturday and Sunday, November 3-4 2018 as part of the ACM 2018 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing in New York City's Hudson River, Jersey City, USA. Selected applicants will be asked to give short, informal presentations during the Colloquium. These will be followed by extensive group discussion in a friendly and constructive workshop. Participants will also present their research in an interactive poster session during the main technical program of the conference.

We welcome applicants from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform CSCW, including anthropology, sociology, information science, computer science, cognitive science, organizational studies, design and related fields. We are particularly interested in applications from institutions and groups that have not traditionally been well-represented at past CSCW conferences.

Applicants should be Ph.D. students with an already established direction of research relevant to CSCW, but whose research would benefit from guidance provided by peers and senior colleagues at the Doctoral Colloquium. Preference will be given to students who have a defined topic and program of work, i.e., who have proposed their topics and are within 2 years of graduation within a 5-year program or are half way through a 3 (or 4) year program.

      title: "About Demonstrations",
      content: `
CSCW 2018 demonstrations present implementations of new CSCW systems and concepts. The curated demonstrations allow conference participants to view novel and noteworthy CSCW systems in action, discuss the systems with those who created them, and try them out. Appropriate demonstrations include applications, technologies, and research prototypes, and may showcase work that has been or is being published at CSCW or elsewhere. Demonstrations can also serve to showcase novel commercial products not previously described in the research literature. 

Compelling demonstrations can include (but are not limited to) the following areas:

* Multi-user interactions with large displays

* Hardware and tangible devices that have the potential for novel cooperative interactions

* Augmented or immersive environments

* Novel social networking systems

* Design interventions in MOOCs or other large learning environments

* Visualizations of collaborative social and work flows

* Crowdsourcing, communitysourcing, or crowdfunding demonstrations

* Demonstrations should be interactive and provide attendees a hands-on experience. Presenters must have been directly involved with the development of the system and be able to explain the unique and novel contributions of the system.

CSCW demos are non-archival. We encourage the submission of demos that were previously shown at other venues but that will be novel to the CSCW audience, as such demos can serve to build bridges between research communities. Authors should state previous demo venues in their submission and point out differences to previous demos.

All questions about Demos should be directed to [demos2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:demos2018@cscw.acm.org).

## Submission Categories ## 

At CSCW 2018 the primary type of demo is the **Reception Demo**. Reception Demos will be showcased during a special evening demo reception. These demonstrations will be spaced around a large room, and will run concurrently during the block of time set aside for demonstrations. Attendees will be free to explore the room and visit demos of interest. This promotes informal interaction and in-depth information exchange among demo presenters and attendees. A demo presentation should be brief so that it can be shown repeatedly to many attendees.

Demonstrators may also propose an **Integrated Demo**. Integrated Demos will run throughout the main conference program, and should enhance the conference experience for attendees. Integrated demos will also receive space at the demo reception where authors can better explain the nature of the demo and associated research in a focused format.

The demo chairs may request additional information or start a dialogue with proposers of integrated demos during the review period to assess feasibility as an integrated demo, as such systems need to be more robust and work without the author’s presence. We will work with authors to determine which format - whether integrated or reception - is most suitable for the proposed demonstration.

Examples of integrated demos might be systems that enable social networking, or that enable collaborative reflection on conference presentations. Although preparing, deploying, and supporting an integrated demo will require a larger commitment of time and effort, it will also provide the presenter with a unique opportunity to gather data about the use of their CSCW system in a structured environment with a diverse user population. If you intend to gather data about the use of your integrated demo, you are responsible for obtaining the approval of any Institutional Review Board (IRB) and/or Human Subjects panels at your home institution, and will need to provide any required consent/disclosure forms for participants. Regardless of whether or not your institution has an IRB, we expect authors to consider the ethical implications of their data collection and demo output.

All demonstrations will be advertised and showcased in the conference pack and throughout the conference. In addition, a panel of judges will select one demonstration to receive a **Best Demo Award** during the reception.

      title: "Submission Materials",
      content : `
Demonstration submissions consist of two required and one optional component.

* A 4-page extended abstract (required) – will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to all attendees
* A demo system summary that describes the logistics of the demonstration (required) – will not be published in the ACM Digital Library
* A video of the system in action, particularly if it helps illustrate the proposed demonstration (optional)

The extended abstract is a description of the project goal or research problem, contribution, and value to CSCW attendees of max. 4 pages. **It will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to all attendees as part of the Conference Extended Abstracts**. The extended abstract details the kind(s) of cooperative activities the demonstration is intended to support, the noteworthy and distinguishing ideas or approaches it embodies, a brief description of the system that will be demoed, and a clear statement of the demo’s relevance to the CSCW audience. The extended abstract should be submitted in PDF format. Please submit it in the **SIGCHI Extended Abstract Format** ([Word](https://cscw.acm.org/2017/submit/sigchi-word-extended-abstracts.zip), [Latex](https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats)).

The demo system summary is a short description of the demo, the team, and the required setup. The system summaries will not be published in the Digital Library. In a separate document, please include answers to the following questions - proposals missing a clear and detailed plan will likely be rejected:

* State whether this is intended as a reception or integrated demo.

* Information about the presenter(s), including their relationship to the project.

* Demonstration requirements. Provide a detailed description of what you need to make the demonstration work, such as needed space, equipment support, and Internet connectivity. If your submission is an integrated demo, please also describe in detail the logistics of how the conference attendees will get access to and interact with the system throughout the conference, and what added value attendees will receive from this special style of presentation.

* Please note if this is a demo of a system described in a CSCW paper accepted for this year’s conference or that has appeared at a past CSCW conference. There’s nothing wrong with this, but it’s useful for us to know. If the system has been demonstrated before, describe if there are any changes for the proposed CSCW demo.

* Do you plan to gather data about attendees’ interactions with the system? If so, describe what data you plan to gather, and an example of the release form that you would ask attendees to sign. If the demo is accepted, proof of final IRB approval must be submitted by October 21st (if your home institution has an IRB). CSCW can provide a "letter of cooperation" to assist with your IRB application, if needed. If your institution does not require IRB approval, a letter stating so from the demo presenters must be submitted instead.

Optionally, the demo submission can be supported by a short Video Figure. The video should be at most two minutes long.

CSCW is an international and interdisciplinary peer reviewed conference seeking the best research on all topics relevant to collaborative and social computing. We invite authors to submit papers that inform the design or deployment of collaborative or social systems; introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms; or study existing collaborative or social practices. The scope of CSCW 2018 includes social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open collaboration, technologically-enabled or enhanced communication, CSCL, MOOCs, and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collaboration, awareness, information sharing, and coordination. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, sociality, entertainment, and ethics. Papers can report on novel research results, systems, or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities.

CSCW encourages papers that make a contribution to building CSCW systems including (but not limited to) technical enablers for CSCW applications; methods and techniques for new CSCW services and applications; and evaluation of fully-built CSCW systems and lab and field settings. 

Contributions to CSCW across a variety of research techniques, approaches, and domains, including:

* Social and crowd computing. Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information behaviors.

* System Design. Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.

* Theories. Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to the design or study of social and collaborative systems.

* Empirical investigations. Findings, guidelines, and/or studies related to communication, collaboration, and social technologies, practices, or use. CSCW 2018 welcomes diverse methods and approaches.

* Mining and Modeling. Studies, analyses and infrastructures for making use of large- and small-scale data.

* Methodologies and tools. Novel methods or combinations of approaches and tools used in building systems or studying their use.

* Domain-specific social and collaborative applications. Including applications to healthcare, transportation, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.

* Collaboration systems based on emerging technologies. Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, or sensing systems.

* Ethics and policy implications of socio-technical systems and the algorithms that shape them.

* Crossing boundaries. Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.

Note that CSCW is moving all publications to the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM). All CSCW papers (including Online First papers) will be include in the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM) journal.

### Submission Process

CSCW 2018 is using a new version of Precision Conference System (PCS 2.0): [https://new.precisionconference.com/](https://new.precisionconference.com/). Please note that you will need to create a new login/password for this system.

PCS 2.0 is still in development, and you are encouraged to report problems or to make interface suggestions to [support@precisionconference.com](mailto:support@precisionconference.com).

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications make the following representations (see [http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations) for full policy statement):

* That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work.

* That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue.

* That the authors have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted, if the work is accepted. For conference papers, this includes the expected ability and intent to have an author of the paper register for and attend the conference to present the paper, if required.

* That any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately in the paper and/or in a cover letter available to reviewers. This documentation includes providing an explanation of the incremental contribution of the submitted CSCW 2018 paper that extends prior results published elsewhere. (In cases of double blind review, this information should be supplied to the program chairs only.)

In cases where an author feels a particular representation cannot be made, but that submission is appropriate, the author should contact the program chairs prior to submission to discuss the situation and determine whether submission will be permitted.

All submissions must be new work that has not been published in a peer reviewed conference or journal. Work previously published in workshops that do not have published proceedings may be submitted (as-is or extended) to CSCW 2018. Work previously published in workshops that do have published proceedings may only be submitted if the work is substantially extended from the workshop paper. In any case where part of a submitted paper has been previously published, the authors should contact the Papers Chairs to inform them of the prior publication, including its citation and a brief description of the changes incorporated into the CSCW 2018 submitted version.

Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SIGCHI regarding specialized conferences: [http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference](http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference)

Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

### Formatting and Length
CSCW has moved to the Proceedings of the ACM - HCI, which uses the ACM Small article template. This template is substantially different from the traditional two-column SIGCHI papers template, and may take extra time to typeset. The ACM Small template is available for download as part of the [ACM Master Template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Please use the most recent version of the master template, even if you have previously downloaded it. Several issues identified during the CSCW 2017 process have been addressed in recent updates. Authors using the Overleaf platform can use the templates provided within Overleaf. Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.

There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length with the new template is about 13 pages. Papers may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages. Shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers longer than 13 pages, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

### Blind Review Policy

Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."

CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Authors may choose to do this at their own risk but they should be aware that this can have implications for the anonymity of their work during the review process.


### Open Review Summaries

In an effort to increase transparency and openness, CSCW will this year publish review summaries of accepted papers as supplementary material in the ACM Digital Library. The review summary will be based on the final meta-review for each paper. This is an experiment that we hope will turn into a tradition within our community. As such, we expect that the process will be improved over time as we learn together from our experiences. Review summaries (edited meta-review) of accepted papers will be published by default. However, when submitting a paper, authors will have the option to opt-out from this experiment. This choice will not impact how the paper is reviewed. (Meta-reviews of rejected papers will not be made public.)

### Video Figures

Consider submitting a video that illustrates your work, either as a video figure judged as part of your submission (no more than three minutes long and 50MB in size), or as a longer stand-alone submission to the video track. Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.

All papers accepted for CSCW 2018 from the Online First or the subsequent final deadline are expected to be presented at CSCW 2018 by at least one of the authors. Presentation format for Online First papers may be different but is guaranteed to include some form of oral presentation at the conference. The conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons. 

### At the Conference

All papers accepted for CSCW 2018 from the Online First or the subsequent Second Cycle final deadline are expected to be presented at CSCW 2018 by at least one of the authors. However, the conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons. Such papers will be included in the proceedings regardless of the author registration status, and we will seek ways for authors to present their work remotely at the conference.

Presentation format for Online First papers may be different but is guaranteed to include some form of oral presentation at the conference.

* Crossing boundaries. Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.

Note that CSCW is moving all publications to the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM). Hence, papers for this interim *Online First* call will be part of Proceedings of the ACM : Human-Computer Interaction: Volume 1: Issue 1: Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing 2017. This will be the inaugural issue of the PACM.

A second CSCW 2018 review process will take place in Spring 2018 (date to be announced). Papers submitted to that deadline will be referred to as Spring 2018 papers.

The CSCW 2018 *Online First* published papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library and will be free for download for up to two years after publication. For more information on this open access model, see:  

http://www.sigchi.org/news/open-table-of-contents-a-new-way-to-access-acm-sigchi-publications.

* That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue.

* That the authors have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted, if the work is accepted. For conference papers, this includes the expected ability and intent to have an author of the paper register for and attend the conference to present the paper, if required.

* That any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately in the paper and/or in a cover letter available to reviewers. This documentation includes providing an explanation of the incremental contribution of the submitted CSCW *Online First* paper that extends prior results published elsewhere. (In cases of double blind review, this information should be supplied to the program chairs only.)

In cases where an author feels a particular representation cannot be made, but that submission is appropriate, the author should contact the program chairs prior to submission to discuss the situation and determine whether submission will be permitted.

All submissions must be new work that has not been published in a peer reviewed conference or journal. Work previously published in workshops that do not have published proceedings may be submitted (as-is or extended) to CSCW *Online First*. Work previously published in workshops that do have published proceedings may only be submitted if the work is substantially extended from the workshop paper. In any case where part of a submitted paper has been previously published, the authors should contact the Papers Chairs to inform them of the prior publication, including its citation and a brief description of the changes incorporated into the CSCW *Online First*-submitted version.

Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SIGCHI regarding specialized conferences: [http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference](http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference)

Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.

### Formatting and Length

Please use the SIGCHI papers template to format your submission (there is a [Word version](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) and a [Latex version](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)). We ask that you use the templates provided here and not the proceedings template provided on the ACM official site. Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.

There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length is 10 pages (formerly the maximum length limit), but may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages — shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers longer than 10 pages, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

### Blind Review Policy

Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors' names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say "Prior work by [authors]" instead of "In our prior work."

### Video Figures

Consider submitting a video that illustrates your work, either as a video figure judged as part of your submission (no more than three minutes long and 50MB in size), or as a longer stand-alone submission to the video track. Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.

      content: 
`
*Note: The review process described below applies to the Online First submissions only, not CSCW Spring 2018 submissions.*

### Revision Cycle

Papers will undergo two review cycles. After the first round of review, a submission will receive either a "Revise & Resubmit" or a "Reject" notification (along with the reviews themselves). Authors of papers designated "Revise & Resubmit" will have two weeks to revise their paper in response to the reviewers' comments. Authors will need to allocate time for possible revisions during the period between June 12th and July 10, 2017. Revised papers must be re-submitted via the PCS system by 11:59 PM PDT on July 10, 2017. Note that an invitation to "Revise & Resubmit" is not a guarantee of acceptance--the revision will be re-reviewed as the basis for the final decision. This is similar to a journal process, except that it is limited to a single revision with a strict deadline.

The revision cycle enables authors to address issues raised by reviewers that may have been a cause for rejection under prior conference reviewing schemes, such as the need to improve readability/grammar, discuss missing citations, redo some analyses, adopt terminology familiar to the field, and/or reframe ideas more clearly. It also allows authors of papers that may have been accepted under a single-cycle approach to further strengthen their papers, perhaps better positioning themselves for consideration for "Best of CSCW 2018" recognition. Along with their revised paper, authors submit a letter explaining the key changes they have made, allowing more interaction between authors and reviewers.

With the resubmission of R&R papers, authors are asked to provide a letter explaining how they approached the comments by the reviewers and incorporated the changes in the revision. See examples of "change summary" documents submitted with papers in past CSCWs.

This is not an invitation to submit extended abstracts or incomplete papers; please submit only work of publishable quality. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will be desk-rejected without review. Based on prior years’ experience with this process, we anticipate that roughly half of submissions will be rejected after the first round of this process. Note that the dual-round review process is not inherently tied to any target acceptance rates.

### Review Criteria

Authors will be able to indicate the primary methodological orientation of their paper, when they upload the paper to the PCS reviewing system:

* Technical/Systems, e.g. building novel systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc.

* Empirical-Qualitative, e.g. ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc.

* Empirical-Quantitative, e.g. "big data," quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc.

* Design, e.g. design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc.

* Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development.

* Theoretical, e.g. conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis.

* This information will be used to match the paper with a program committee member who is experienced with work of that character. CSCW values work from a variety of interdisciplinary and methodological perspectives - specific evaluation types are not a prerequisite for acceptance (Greenberg & Buxton, 2008).

Greenberg, S., and Buxton, B. "Usability evaluation considered harmful (Some of the time)" in: CHI, ACM, Florence, Italy, 2008, pp. 111-120.

### "Best of CSCW 2018" Awards

CSCW 2018 *Online First* papers will be considered for "Best of CSCW" awards with the full set of 2018 accepted papers in accordance with SIGCHI guidelines. Papers that have been nominated as noteworthy by reviewers or Program Committee members will receive additional review by the Best Papers Committee, who will identify "Honorable Mention" and "Best" awards. Approximately 5% of submissions may be nominated and 1% of total submissions awarded Best Paper. 

### Accepted Papers

Authors will be expected to prepare a camera-ready version of their paper in accordance with ACM’s Digital Library formatting guidelines. Authors may be asked to identify funding sources (to assist in compliance with government access mandates). Further information will be provided at the time of acceptance.

The CSCW Proceedings is a peer-reviewed archival publication. Note: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. For *Online First *submissions, this date would be in late 2017. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Authors of accepted papers will have to choose whether to pay for open-access publication (this decision is made after acceptance and will not affect the review decision). Authors also will have to choose among three options for rights management: copyright transfer (or government copyright), a limited exclusive right to publish, or author-retained rights (only for author-paid open access articles). All authors of ACM-published articles retain substantial rights, see http://authors.acm.org for more details.

All papers accepted for CSCW 2018 from either the Online First or subsequent final deadline are expected to be presented at CSCW 2018 by at least one of the authors. The presentation format may differ for Online First papers but is guaranteed to include some form of oral presentation at the conference. The conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons.
