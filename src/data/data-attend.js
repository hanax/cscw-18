CSCW 2018 attendees may be affected by the [Executive Order signed by the President of the United States in 2017](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_travel_ban). This Executive Order banned most people from entering the U.S. if they hold passports from a specific set of countries (Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen,and  Somalia). We will work to accommodate any presenting authors who cannot travel to the US for visa reasons related to the ban. These authorsâ€™ papers will be included in the proceedings regardless of the author registration and attendance status, and we will seek ways for authors to remotely present their work at the conference. If you are such an author, please email the general chairs at [chairs2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:chairs2018@cscw.acm.org).

In addition, we will attempt to accommodate interested attendees from those countries that are not able to attend for reasons related to the ban, though we may limited capacity to support such attendees. Email the telepresence chairs at [tele2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:tele2018@cscw.acm.org) for details.

We support statements made by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the International Science Council (ICSU) that the free and responsible practice of science is fundamental to scientific advancement and human and environmental well-being and, furthermore, that the practice of science requires freedom of movement, association, expression and communication. 

We welcome questions and suggestions from the community about this topic.

The [Hyatt Regency](https://jerseycity.regency.hyatt.com/) is a short walk to the Exchange Place PATH Station with [frequent trains](http://www.panynj.gov/path/maps-schedules.html) running directly across the Hudson to the World Trade Center site.

The PATH also runs further north in Manhattan which makes connecting to the MTA subway trains like the 4,5,6 and A, C, E quite effortless. The nearby ferry terminal, Paulus Hook, offers rides to Wall Street, the World Financial Center, and Midtown (W 39th). From the Hyatt Regency, taking public transportation, you can get to the Financial District in less than 15 minutes, or to Times Square in about 30 minutes. Getting to the Whitney Museum and the New Museum also takes about 30 minutes, and the Empire State Building is 35 minutes away. You can get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the Upper East side and other Museum Mile attractions in less than an hour, again, all on public transport.
