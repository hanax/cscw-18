The [Hyatt Regency](https://jerseycity.regency.hyatt.com/) is a short walk to the Exchange Place PATH Station with [frequent trains](http://www.panynj.gov/path/maps-schedules.html) running directly across the Hudson to the World Trade Center site.

The PATH also runs further north in Manhattan which makes connecting to the MTA subway trains like the 4,5,6 and A, C, E quite effortless. The nearby ferry terminal, Paulus Hook, offers rides to Wall Street, the World Financial Center, and Midtown (W 39th). From the Hyatt Regency, taking public transportation, you can get to the Financial District in less than 15 minutes, or to Times Square in about 30 minutes. Getting to the Whitney Museum and the New Museum also takes about 30 minutes, and the Empire State Building is 35 minutes away. You can get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the Upper East side and other Museum Mile attractions in less than an hour, again, all on public transport.
