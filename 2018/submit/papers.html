We invite authors to submit papers that inform the design or deployment of collaborative or social systems; introduce novel systems, interaction techniques, or algorithms; or study existing collaborative or social practices. The scope of CSCW 2018 includes social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, open collaboration, technologically-enabled or enhanced communication, CSCL, MOOCs, and related educational technologies, multi-user input technologies, collaboration, awareness, information sharing, and coordination. This scope spans socio-technical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, sociality, entertainment, and ethics. Papers can report on novel research results, systems, or new ways of thinking about, studying, or supporting shared activities.</p>
<p>CSCW encourages papers that make a contribution to building CSCW systems including (but not limited to) technical enablers for CSCW applications; methods and techniques for new CSCW services and applications; and evaluation of fully-built CSCW systems and lab and field settings.</p>
<p>Contributions to CSCW across a variety of research techniques, approaches, and domains, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Social and crowd computing</strong>. Studies, theories, designs, mechanisms, systems, and/or infrastructures addressing social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds or collaborative information behaviors.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>System design</strong>. Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Crossing boundaries</strong>. Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distance, languages, generations, and cultures, to help better understand how to transcend social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that CSCW is moving all publications to the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM). All CSCW papers (including Online First papers) will be include in the Proceedings of the ACM (PACM) journal.</p>
<p>To bridge the gap until the 2018 paper deadline, we offered an <em>Online First</em> call for paper participation. The Online First deadline has passed, but details about this process can be found <a href="./archived.html">here</a>.</p>

Please note that you will need to create a new login/password for this system.</p>
<p>PCS 2.0 is still in development, and you are encouraged to report problems or to make interface suggestions to <a href="mailto:support@precisionconference.com">support@precisionconference.com</a>.</p>
<p>Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications make the following representations (see <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations">http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/author_representations</a> for full policy statement):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue, and that it will not be submitted to another venue unless it has been rejected or withdrawn from this venue.</p>
</li>
<li><p>That the authors have the rights and intent to publish the work in the venue to which it is submitted, if the work is accepted. For conference papers, this includes the expected ability and intent to have an author of the paper register for and attend the conference to present the paper, if required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>That any prior publications on which this work is based are documented appropriately in the paper and/or in a cover letter available to reviewers. This documentation includes providing an explanation of the incremental contribution of the submitted CSCW 2018 paper that extends prior results published elsewhere. (In cases of double blind review, this information should be supplied to the program chairs only.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In cases where an author feels a particular representation cannot be made, but that submission is appropriate, the author should contact the program chairs prior to submission to discuss the situation and determine whether submission will be permitted.</p>
<p>All submissions must be new work that has not been published in a peer reviewed conference or journal. Work previously published in workshops that do not have published proceedings may be submitted (as-is or extended) to CSCW 2018. Work previously published in workshops that do have published proceedings may only be submitted if the work is substantially extended from the workshop paper. In any case where part of a submitted paper has been previously published, the authors should contact the Papers Chairs to inform them of the prior publication, including its citation and a brief description of the changes incorporated into the CSCW 2018 submitted version.</p>
<p>Regarding the re-publication in English of work previously published in another language, please refer to the statement by ACM SIGCHI regarding specialized conferences: <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference">http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/organizing-a-sigchi-sponsored-conference</a>.</p>
<p>Confidentiality of submitted material will be maintained. Upon acceptance, the titles, authorship, and abstracts of papers will be used in the Advance Program. Submissions should contain no information or material that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication, and should cite no publication that will be proprietary or confidential at that time. Final versions of accepted papers must be formatted according to detailed instructions provided by the publisher. Copyright release forms must be signed for inclusion in the proceedings and the ACM Digital Library.</p>
</div></div><div class="content-item"><div id="Formatting and Length" class="title">Formatting and Length</div><div class="separator"><span class="fa fa-circle"></span><span class="fa fa-circle"></span><span class="fa fa-circle"></span></div><div class="content"><p>CSCW has moved to the Proceedings of the ACM - HCI, which uses the ACM Small article template. This template is substantially different from the traditional two-column SIGCHI papers template, and may take extra time to typeset. The ACM Small template is available for download as part of the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Master Template</a>. Please use the most recent version of the master template, even if you have previously downloaded it. Several issues identified during the CSCW 2017 process have been addressed in recent updates. Word users: if the typefaces are not showing up correctly, be sure you have installed the fonts included in the ACM template download. Authors using the Overleaf platform can use the templates provided within Overleaf. Papers should be converted to PDF before submission.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In preparing initial submissions, authors should make their best effort at matching the ACM-Small template styles and conventions, but please don’t worry about perfect formatting at this stage! Any smaller formatting issues can be addressed during the revision cycle and camera-ready preparation stage.</p>
<p>There is no minimum or maximum length imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers should report research thoroughly but succinctly: brevity is a virtue. A typical length with the new template is about 13-15 pages (excluding images and references). Last year, most papers were under 10,000 words. Papers may be shorter if the contribution can be described and supported in fewer pages. Shorter, more focused papers (called Notes in prior years) are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. While we will review papers that exceed the typical length, the contribution must warrant the extra length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.</p>
</div></div><div class="content-item"><div id="Blind Review Policy" class="title">Blind Review Policy</div><div class="separator"><span class="fa fa-circle"></span><span class="fa fa-circle"></span><span class="fa fa-circle"></span></div><div class="content"><p>Papers are subject to blind reviewing. Your submission should have authors&#39; names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying yourself as the author. For example, say &quot;Prior work by [authors]&quot; instead of &quot;In our prior work.&quot;</p>
<p>CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Authors may choose to do this at their own risk but they should be aware that this can have implications for the anonymity of their work during the review process.</p>

The review summary will be based on the final meta-review for each paper. This is an experiment that we hope will turn into a tradition within our community. As such, we expect that the process will be improved over time as we learn together from our experiences. Review summaries (edited meta-review) of accepted papers will be published by default. However, when submitting a paper, authors will have the option to opt-out from this experiment. This choice will not impact how the paper is reviewed. (Meta-reviews of rejected papers will not be made public.)</p>

Videos are not required for paper submissions, but are strongly encouraged, particularly for papers contributing novel systems or interaction techniques.</p>

However, the conference will find ways to accommodate those who are unable to travel to the United States due to geo-political reasons. Such papers will be included in the proceedings regardless of the author registration status, and we will seek ways for authors to present their work remotely at the conference.</p>
<p>Presentation format for Online First papers may be different but is guaranteed to include some form of oral presentation at the conference.</p>
