The Doctoral Colloquium will be held on Saturday and Sunday, November 3-4 2018 as part of the ACM 2018 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing in New York City&#39;s Hudson River, Jersey City, USA. Selected applicants will be asked to give short, informal presentations during the Colloquium. These will be followed by extensive group discussion in a friendly and constructive workshop. Participants will also present their research in an interactive poster session during the main technical program of the conference.</p>
<p>We welcome applicants from a broad range of disciplines and approaches that inform CSCW, including anthropology, sociology, information science, computer science, cognitive science, organizational studies, design and related fields. We are particularly interested in applications from institutions and groups that have not traditionally been well-represented at past CSCW conferences.</p>
<p>Applicants should be Ph.D. students with an already established direction of research relevant to CSCW, but whose research would benefit from guidance provided by peers and senior colleagues at the Doctoral Colloquium. Preference will be given to students who have a defined topic and program of work, i.e., who have proposed their topics and are within 2 years of graduation within a 5-year program or are half way through a 3 (or 4) year program.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A FOUR-page overview of your doctoral research that describes your research question, work in progress, and expected contributions. This overview should also include (1) a paragraph that articulates what you hope to gain from attending the CSCW Doctoral Colloquium, and (2) an abstract of no more than 100 words. Your overview will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed to all attendees as part of the Conference Extended Abstracts. Please submit your overview in the SIGCHI Extended Abstract Format (<a href="https://cscw.acm.org/2017/submit/sigchi-word-extended-abstracts.zip">Word</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sigchi/Document-Formats">Latex</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A short (2-3 paragraph) biographical sketch on another page, with a list of five top publications</p>
</li>
<li><p>As part of the submission email, please indicate the availability of funds to attend the colloquium (e.g., complete funds available through the university/research grant, partial funds available, applied for the SIGCHI Student Travel Grant and was awarded, applied for a travel grant but was not awarded, etc.). See below under Important Note on Funding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optionally, one publication that you feel best illustrates your progress in your research.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An email letter from your supervisor sent to dc2018@cscw.acm.org](mailto:dc2018@cscw.acm.org) indicating that they support your application to the colloquium and they agree that your research is at an appropriate stage for participation. These letters should also make reference to how you might benefit from the Doctoral Colloquium and how they expect that you might benefit the other students in this group experience. The email should have “CSCW DC: YOUR NAME” in the subject header.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All submissions must be received by the chairs by 11:59pm PDT on June 1, 2018. Submissions received after this date will not be considered. Submissions will be acknowledged by email once they have been checked for completeness.</p>
